/*!
 * @brief A container which holds relationship connections between two
 * BoxLevels.
 *
 * Connectors have a notion of a "base" and a "head", representing a
 * directional relationship between two BoxLevels.  The relationships
 * are a collection of Boxes in the head, pointed to by a Box in
 * the base.   The association between base and head relationships is
 * 1 .. 0-many.  That is, one Box in the base can be related to zero or
 * more Boxes (called its NeighborSet) in the head.
 *
 * @par Usage
 * Connections in a Connector can have three possible relationships:
 *
 * # A Box in the base has no related NeighborSet.  In this case,
 *   the Box in the base will exist as-is in the head.
 * # A Box in the base has NeighborSet which is empty.  In this case, the
 *   Box from the base will not exist in the head BoxLevel.
 * # A Box in the base has a corresponding NeighborSet which in
 *   non-empty.  In this case, the NeighborSet contains the set of Boxes
 *   to which the Box in the base is related.
