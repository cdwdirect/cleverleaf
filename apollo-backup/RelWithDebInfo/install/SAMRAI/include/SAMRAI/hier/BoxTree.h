/*!
 * @brief Utility sorting Boxes into tree-like form for finding
 * box overlaps.
 *
 * This class recursively splits a set of Boxes into tree-like
 * form and stores them for fast searches.  The recursive
 * splitting stops when the number of boxes in a leaf node of the tree
 * is less than a minimum number specified in the constructor.
 *
 * All boxes in a BoxTree must exist in the same index space.
 * This means that they must all have the same BlockId value.
 *
 * Overlap searches are done by
 * - hasOverlap()
 * - findOverlapBoxes()
 *
 * Except for two static methods and a destructor needed by shared_ptr,
 * the entire interface is private.
