 * @brief A distributed set of Box objects which reside in the
 * same index space.
 *
 *
 * TODO: Are we eliminating DLBG terminology?
 *
 * This class is a part of the distributed layered box graph (DLBG) for
 * managing SAMR meshes in parallel.  A BoxLevel is a set of
 * boxes in the same index space. Relationships (e.g., neighbor adjacency)
 * among boxes is contained in a Connector object. Also, each BoxLevel
 * has an refinement ratio vector describing the relationship of the
 * index space to that of a reference level in a patch hierarchy (typically
 * the coarsest level or level zero).
 *
 * Like a PatchLevel, a BoxLevel is a parallel object.  The
 * Boxes of a BoxLevel may be distributed across all the
 * processors in an MPI communicator and can be in one
 * of two parallel states:
 *
 * - @b DISTRIBUTED: Each MPI process knows only the Boxes in the set
 * that are "owned" by that process.  This is analogous to a PatchLevel
 * which owns only the Patches that reside on a process.
 *
 * - @b GLOBALIZED: All processes know all Boxes in the set.
 * This is analogous to PatchLevel BoxContainer state when it is globalized
 * (@see PatchLevel::getBoxes()).
 *
 * @par Performance notes
 * <ul>
 * <li> The parallel state is changed by calling setParallelState().  Going
 * from DISTRIBUTED to GLOBALIZED state is an expensive operation requiring
 * all-to-all communication.  Using this state can incur a significant
 * performance penalty.
 *
 * <li> The GLOBALIZED state requires more memory.
 *
 * <li> Transitioning from GLOBALIZED state to DISTRIBUTED state is
 * cheap.
 * </ul>
 *
 * @note
 * The general attributes of a BoxLevel are
 * <ul>
 * <li> the set of Box objects with unique BoxIds,
 * <li> the refinement ratio defining their index space, and
 * <li> the parallel state.
 * </ul>
 *
 * Box object uniqueness is based on the Box equality operator,
 * which compares owner MPI ranks and local indices.  Therefore,
 * a valid BoxLevel does not contain two Boxes with the same
 * owner and index.
