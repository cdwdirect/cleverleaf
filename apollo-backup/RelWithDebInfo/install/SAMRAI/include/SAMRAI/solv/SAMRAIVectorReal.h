/**
 * Class SAMRAIVectorReal allows a collection of patch data types
 * (with double or float data, but not both) defined over a SAMRAI hierarchy
 * to be manipulated as though they are all part of a single vector.
 * Specifically, this class provides a set of common vector operations
 * to manipulate all of the data components as a whole.  The most obvious
 * use of this class is in SAMRAI applications that use solver libraries,
 * such as KINSOL, CVODE, or PETSc.  Specific vector objects that can be
 * used with these packages are defined elsewhere in SAMRAI.  However, all
 * these vactor interfaces are built using this vector class.
 *
 * This class defines a vector to be any collection of patch data objects
 * (either cell-, edge-, face-, node, or side-centered, or any combination
 * of these) defined over a set of patch levels in an AMR hierarchy.  All of
 * the data objects must have the same underlying data type, either double
 * or float.  The vector structure is composed by adding individual
 * variable quantities to the vector after it is constructed.  When a
 * component is added, a weighting or "control volume" component
 * (having the same type as the vector component) may also be added
 * to the vector.  These weights are used to define the contribution of
 * each vector entry to summing operations such as norms and dot products.
 * For example, the weights can be used to mask out coarse level vector
 * data entries in cells that are covered by fine cells when the coarse data
 * are not actually part of the solution vector.  The weights can also be
 * used to map the vector operations to grid-based operations that define
 * control volume weights.   It is important to note that the centering
 * of each control volume component must match that of the vector component
 * with which it is associated.
 *
 * Typical usage of this vector class is as follows:
 *
 * - @b (1) Construct a vector instance by specifying the patch hierarchy
 *            and range of levels over which the vector is defined.
 *            The levels must exist in the hierarchy before the vector
 *            can be used or an assertion will result.  However, a vector
 *            may be created before the levels exist.  The range of levels
 *            can be reset (such as after remeshing) by calling the
 *            resetLevels() function.
 * - @b (2) Register each data component with the vector by providing
 *            the variable and its storage location (i.e., patch data
 *            index), and the control volume index if needed.
 *            See the addComponent() functions.
 * - @b (3) Manipulate data using vector operations.
 *
 *
 * Before the vector operations can be used, the storage for each of its
 * components must be allocated.  Storage allocation is only possible
 * through a vector object after all component variables are added to
 * the vector (using the addComponent() function).
 * Then, the allocateVectorData() function will allocate storage for all
 * components when called.  Alternatively, patch data objects (corresponding
 * to the variables and vector patch data indices) may be
 * explicitly created elsewhere.  However, depending on the circumstance, this
 * second alternative may be more confusing and require more bookkeeping on
 * the user's part.  See the documentation accompanying the addComponent()
 * function for more information.
 *

   /**
    * Constructor for SAMRAIVectorReal class is used to construct
    * each unique vector within an application.  That is, each vector
    * that is used to represent a unique set of variable quantities is
    * considered unique.  This constructor is used to create a solution
    * vector for an application or solver algorithm.  The cloneVector()
    * function is provided to generate copies of a given vector.  For example,
    * the clone function may be used by a solver to generate copies of
    * the vector as needed; e.g., in a Krylov subspace method like GMRES.
    *
    * Before the vector may be used, data components must be added to it using
    * the adddComponent(0 function.  Also, this constructor does not allocate
    * storage for vector data.  This is usually done after all components are
    * added.  The allocateVectorData() function is used for this
    * purpose.  Otherwise, existing patch data quantities can be
    * added as vector components.  In any case, storage for all
    * components must be allocated before the vector can be used.
    *
    * The range levels can be reset at any time (e.g., if the level
    * configuration changes by re-meshing), by calling the resetLevels() member
    * function.
    *
    * Although an empty std::string may be passed as the vector name, it is
    * recommended that a descriptive name be used to facilitate debugging
    * and error reporting.
    *
    * By default the vector component information and data will be sent to
    * the "plog" output stream when the print() function is called.  This
    * stream can be changed at any time via the setOutputStream() function.
