 * @brief Class CompositeBoundaryAlgorithm describes a pattern for
 * a communication and representation of data at coarse-fine boundaries.
 *
 * The purpose of this class is to allow an application code that is operating
 * on a particular Patch from a PatchHierarchy to have a local view into data
 * from the next finer level that exists within a certain stencil width of the
 * Patch's coarse-fine boundaries (if it has any).
 *
 * CompositeBoundaryAlgorithm holds the the desired stencil width for
 * a composite boundary description, and manages the patch data ids for
 * the data that is desired to be accessed at the composity boundaries.
 * The stencil width and data ids should be set once in the life of an
 * instance of this object.  Once its state is set, CompositeBoundaryAlglorithm
 * can repeatedly call createSchedule to create new CompositeBoundarySchedules
 * at different levels and at different times in the run of an application.
 *
