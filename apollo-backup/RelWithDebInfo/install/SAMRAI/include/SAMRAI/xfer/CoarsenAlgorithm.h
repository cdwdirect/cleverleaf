 * @brief Class CoarsenAlgorithm encapsulates the AMR communication
 * pattern to coarsen data from a finer level to any coarser level.
 *
 * Most often, data is coarsened from the interiors of source patch
 * components on the source patch level into interiors of destination
 * patch components on the destination level.  If the coarsening operators
 * require ghost cells on a source component, then sufficient ghost cell
 * storage must be provided by the source patch data component, and those
 * ghost cells must be filled before calling the data coarsening routines.
 *
 * Communication algorithms generally consist of three parts: an algorithm,
 * a schedule, and a patch strategy.  The algorithm describes the communication
 * between patch data items but is independent of the configuration of the
 * AMR hierarchy.  PatchData items and their associated coarsening
 * operators are registered with the algorithm.  To generate the communication
 * dependencies for a particular hierarchy configuration, the algorithm
 * generates a schedule based on the current hierarchy configuration.  This
 * schedule then performs the communication based on the registered data types
 * and their associated operators.  User-defined coarsening operations can
 * be written using the interfaces in CoarsenPatchStrategy for
 * preprocessCoarsen() and postProcessCoarsen().
 *
 * The source patch data space is used during processing to store temporary
 * data.  Thus, the user-defined coarsening operators should operate on the
 * source space by using the patch data with those indices.
 *
 * It is the user's responsibility to register valid operations with the
 * coarsen algorithm so that the data communication can occur.  In particular,
 * communication operations (e.g., data coarsening, data copy, etc.) are
 * performed in the order that items are registered for coarsening with
 * a coarsen algorithm object.  Thus, order of registration must repect any
 * dependencies among patch data communicated.  Also, users who use
 * the preprocessCoarsen() and postProcessCoarsen() operations in the patch
 * strategy object must make sure that all data that is needed in those
 * operations are registered with the CoarsenAlgorithm using registerCoarsen()
 * whether or not the data is to be coarsened.
 *
 * Typical usage of a coarsen algorithm to perform data coarsening
 * on an AMR hierarchy involves four steps:
 *
 * <ul>
 *    <li> Construct a coarsen algorithm object.
 *    <li> Register coarsen operations with the coarsen algorithm.  Using the
 *         registerCoarsen() methods(s), one provides source and destination
 *         patch data information, as well as spatial coarsening operators
 *         as needed.
 *    <li> After all operations are registered with the algorithm, one
 *         creates a communication schedule using the createSchedule()
 *         method.  This method identifies the source (fine) and destination
 *         (coarse) patch levels for data coarsening.  Note that when creating
 *         a communication schedule, a concrete instance of a
 *         CoarsenPatchStrategy object may be required to supply
 *         user-defined spatial data coarsening operations.
 *    <li> Invoke the coarsenData() method in the communication schedule to
 *         perform the data transfers.
 * </ul>
 *
 * Note that each coarsen schedule created by a coarsen algorithm remains valid
 * as long as the levels involved in the communication process do not change;
 * thus, they can be used for multiple data communication cycles.

    * level will be coarsened into the source component of a temporary (coarse)
    * patch level and then copied into the destination component on the
    * destination (coarse) patch level.  If the coarsening operator requires
    * data in ghost cells outside of the patch interiors (i.e., a non-zero
    * stencil width), then those ghost cells must exist in the source patch
    * data component and the ghost cells must be filled with valid data on the
    * source level before a call to invoke the communication schedule.  Note
    * that the source and destination components may be the same.
    *
    * Some special circumstances require that data be coarsened from the
    * ghost cell regions of a finer level and the resulting coarsened data
    * should be copied to the destination patch level.  When this is the case,
    * the optional integer vector argument should be set to the cell width, in
    * the destination (coarser) level index space, of the region around the
    * fine level where this coarsening should occur.  For example, if the
    * coarser level needs data in a region two (coarse) cells wide around the
    * boundary of the finer level, then the gcw_to_coarsen should be set to a
    * vector with all entries set to two.  Moreover, if the ratio
