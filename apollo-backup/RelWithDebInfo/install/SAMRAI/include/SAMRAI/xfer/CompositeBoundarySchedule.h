 * @brief Class CompositeBoundarySchedule manages the communication and access
 * of patch data objects that hold data at a composite boundary.
 *
 * The purpose of this class is to allow an application code that is operating
 * on a particular Patch from a PatchHierarchy to have a local view into data
 * from the next finer level that exists within a certain stencil width of the
 * Patch's coarse-fine boundaries (if it has any).
 *
 * The recommended usage is to create a CompositeBoundaryAlgorithm to hold
 * the stencil width and the patch data ids, and use
 * CompositeBoundaryAlgorithm::createSchedule to create instances of this
 * class.

    * The stencil width is interpreted in terms of the resolution of finer
    * levels.  So if the value is 4, that means that code operating on level n
    * will be able to see a coarse-fine stencil of width 4 in the mesh 
    * resolution of level n + 1;

    * next finer level is changed by a regrid of the hierarchy.
