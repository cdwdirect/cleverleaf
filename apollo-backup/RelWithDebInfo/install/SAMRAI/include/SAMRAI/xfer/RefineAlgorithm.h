 * @brief Class RefineAlgorithm encapsulates the AMR communication
 * pattern to refine data to, copy data to, or fill physical boundary data on
 * any destination patch level.
 *
 * The basic procedure for moving data follows three steps:
 *
 * <ul>
 *    <li> interpolate data (spatial and possibly temporal) from coarser levels
 *    <li> copy data from the same level of refinement
 *    <li> fill physical boundary conditions regions
 * </ul>
 *
 * Each data communication procedure generally consists of three parts: an
 * algorithm, a schedule, and a patch strategy.  The algorithm describes
 * the patch data components and time and space interpolation operations,
 * but is independent of the configuration of the patches in an AMR hierarchy.
 * Patch data items and their associated spatial and time interpolation
 * operators are registered with an instantiation of this algorithm class.
 * To generate the communication dependencies for a particular patch hierarchy
 * configuration, the algorithm creates a refine schedule based on the state
 * of a given hierarchy and the information in the algorithm.  The schedule
 * can then perform the communication operations that move data to the
 * destination patch level using the associated operators.  User-defined
 * operations (such as filling physical boundaries and special interpolation
 * procedures) are provided through a refine patch strategy object.
 * User-defined interpolation operations can be written using the interfaces
 * in RefinePatchStrategy for preprocessRefine() and postProcessRefine().
 *
 * In general, source data is copied into the designated scratch data for
 * temporary processing.  The scratch space must contain sufficient ghost
 * cells to accommodate the stencil width of the given interpolation operators
 * and any physical boundary data that must be filled.  The scratch storage is
 * copied into the destination data space at the end of the communication
 * process.  Thus, copy operations between source, scratch, and destination
 * patch data objects must be defined.
 *
 * In general, the destination and scratch data components may be the same
 * (assuming that the scratch component has a sufficient ghost cells width).
 * The source and scratch components SHOULD NOT be the same, since the
 * interiors of the source space could be changed by the use of the scratch
 * data as temporary work space.
 *
 * It is the user's responsibility to register valid operations with the
 * refine algorithm so that the data communication can occur.  In particular,
 * communication operations (e.g., data refinement, data copy, etc.) are
 * performed in the order that items are registered for refinement with
 * a refine algorithm object.  Thus, order of registration must repect any
 * dependencies among patch data communicated.  Also, users who use
 * the preprocessRefine() and postProcessRefine() operations in the patch
 * strategy object must make sure that all data that is needed in those
 * operations are registered with the RefineAlgorithm using registerRefine()
 * whether or not the data is to be refined.
 *
 * Typical usage of a refine algorithm to perform inter-patch communication
 * on an AMR hierarchy involves four steps:
 *
 * <ul>
 *    <li> Construct a refine algorithm object.
 *    <li> Register refine operations with the refine algorithm.  Using the
 *         registerRefine() methods(s), one provides source and destination
 *         patch data information, as well as time and space interpolation
 *         operators as needed.  Two registerRefine() methods appear in this
 *         class; one supports time interpolation, one does not.
 *    <li> After all operations are registered with the algorithm, one
 *         creates a communication schedule using one of the createSchedule()
 *         methods.  These methods are distinguished by the resulting data
 *         communication pattern (e.g., interpatch communication on a single
 *         level, between two different levels at the same grid resolution,
 *         interpolation of data between different AMR hierarchy levels, etc.)
 *         Note that when creating a communication schedule, a concrete
 *         instance of a RefinePatchStrategy object may be required
 *         to supply physical boundary conditions as well as user-defined
 *         spatial data interpolation operations.
 *    <li> Invoke the fillData() method in the communication schedule to
 *         perform the data transfers.
 * </ul>
 *
 * Note that each refine schedule created by a refine algorithm remains valid
 * as long as the patches involved in the communication process do not change;
 * thus, they can be used for multiple data communication cycles.

    * @brief Create a communication schedule that communicates data from a
    * source level to a destination level and interpolates data from coarser
    * hierarchy levels where needed.
    *
    * Data will be communicated from the interiors of the source data on
    * on the source level to the interiors and ghosts of destination data on
    * the destination level where those sources and destinations overlap.
    * Where they do not overlap, data will be interpolated from source data on
    * coarser levels in the patch hierarchy.
    *
    * Data is time interpolated between old and new sources on coarser levels
    * when and where time interpolation is needed and copied from the source
    * components on the source level into the destination components otherwise.
    *
    * This form of schedule construction is typically used after regridding
    * (where the source level is the patch level being replaced by the
    * destination level in the patch hierarchy) or when the data on destination
    * patch level is to be overwritten by data interpolated from coarser levels
    * in the patch hierarchy.  In the first case, data on the destination level
    * will be copied from the source level in regions where those two levels
    * overlap and filled with interpolated values from the hierarchy elsewhere.
    * In the latter case, the source level pointer may be null.  Then, data on
    * the destination level will be filled using interpolated data from coarser
    * hierarchy levels.
    *
    * In certain rare cases in may be desired to perform time interpolation
    * between old and new sources onto the destination level.  In this case
    * the optional argument use_time_interpolation should be set to true.
    * Regardless of the value of this argument, time interpolation on
    * coarser levels will always occur whenever needed.
    *
    * Note that when the source level pointer is non-null, the index spaces of
    * the source and destination levels must be aligned with one another.
    *
    * Note that the schedule remains valid as long as the levels involved
    * in its creation do not change; thus, it can be used for multiple
    * data communication cycles.
    *
    * @return std::shared_ptr to refine schedule that performs the data
    *         transfers.
    *
    * @param[in] dst_level      std::shared_ptr to destination level; cannot
    *                           be null.
    * @param[in] src_level      std::shared_ptr to source level. This pointer
    *                           may be null.  In this case, data on the
    *                           destination level will be filled only using
    *                           interpolated data from coarser hierarchy
    *                           levels.  When this pointer is not null, the
    *                           source level must live in the same AMR

    *                                destination level.  Note that when the
    *                                destination level has number zero (i.e.,
    *                                the coarsest level), this value should
    *                                value should be < 0.
    * @param[in] hierarchy    std::shared_ptr to patch hierarchy from which
    *                         data to fill level should come.  This pointer may
    *                         be null only when the next_coarser_level is < 0.
    * @param[in] patch_strategy  std::shared_ptr to a refine patch strategy
    *                            that provides user-defined physical boundary
    *                            filling operations and user-defined spatial
    *                            interpolation operations.  If this patch
    *                            strategy is null (default state), then no
    *                            physical boundary filling or user-defined
    *                            interpolation is performed.  Note that this
    *                            may cause problems if the interpolation
    *                            stencils require physical boundary data on
    *                            the coarser levels.
    * @param[in] use_time_interpolation  Boolean flag to create the schedule
