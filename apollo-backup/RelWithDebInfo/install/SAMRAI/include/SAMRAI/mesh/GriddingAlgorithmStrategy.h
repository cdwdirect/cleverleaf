    *
    * The given level number is that of the coarsest level on which
    * cells will be selected for refinement.  In other words, that
    * level is the finest level that will not be subject to a change
    * in its patch configuration during the regridding process.
    * Generally, this routine should be used to alter the pre-existing
    * AMR patch hierarchy based on the need to adapt the computational
    * mesh around some phenomenon of interest.  The routine
    * makeFinerLevel() above should be used to construct the initial
    * hierarchy configuration or to add more than one new level into
    * the hierarchy.  Also, this routine will not reconfigure the
    * patches on level 0 (i.e., the coarsest in the hierarchy).  The
    * routine makeCoarsestLevel() above is provided for that purpose.

    * The boolean level_is_coarsest_to_sync is used for regridding in
    * time-dependent problems.  When true, it indicates that the
    * specified level is the coarsest level to synchronize at the
    * current regrid time before this regridding method is called.
    * This is a pretty idiosyncratic argument but allows some
    * flexibility in the way memory is managed during time-dependent
    * regridding operations.

    *                     refinement
