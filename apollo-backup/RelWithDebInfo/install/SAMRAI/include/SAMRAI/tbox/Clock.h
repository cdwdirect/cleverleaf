/**
 * Class Clock serves as a single point of access for system clock
 * information.  System and user time are computed via the POSIX compliant
 * times() function.  This is described on p. 137, Lewine, POSIX programmers
 * guide, 1992.  The methods and structs used in this utility are defined
 * in <sys/times.h>.  Start and end times are stored as variables of type
 * clock_t.  A clock_t value can be converted to seconds by dividing by
 * CLK_TCK (which is defined in <sys/times.h>).  Different systems may use
 * different CLK_TCK.  Time is accessed by calling the times() function which
 * takes as an argument a reference to an object of type struct tms.  This
 * object will record the system and user time (obj.tms_utime \&
 * obj.tms_stime) and will return the time since the system was started.
 *
 * The return value from the call to times() can be used to compute elapsed
 * wallclock time.  Alternatively, one can use SAMRAI_MPI::Wtime() if MPI
 * libraries are included.  Two methods are defined for accessing system time
 * - one that has a clock_t struct argument for wallclock time (the non-MPI
 * case) and one that has a double argument to record the value of
 * SAMRAI_MPI::Wtime().
 *
 * Computing user/system/wallclock time with the times() function is performed
 * as follows:
 * \verbatim
 *    struct tms buffer;
 *    clock_t wtime_start = times(&buffer);
 *    clock_t stime_start = buffer.tms_stime;
 *    clock_t utime_start = buffer.tms_utime;
 *     (do some computational work)
 *    clock_t wtime_stop  = times(&buffer);
 *    clock_t stime_stop  = buffer.tms_stime;
 *    clock_t utime_stop  = buffer.tms_utime;
 *    double wall_time   = double(wtime_stop-wtime_start)/double(CLK_TCK);
 *    double user_time   = double(utime_stop-utime_start)/double(CLK_TCK);
 *    double sys_time    = double(stime_stop-stime_start)/double(CLK_TCK);
 * \endverbatim
 *
