 * @brief Class MemoryUtilities provides utility methods for memory usage and
 * misc memory utilities.
 *
 * "printMemoryInfo()" which does a simple dump of the current memory
 * usage on a processor, and "recordMemoryInfo()" which records the
 * memory for post-process analysis.
 *
 * Calls to these methods may be placed at various points in an application
 * to track memory usage characteristics.  For applications running on a
 * single processor, the  call the print method is likely sufficient. The
 * information can simply be printed to a log file or output stream. 
 *
 * Note that all member functions of this class are static so it is not
 * necessary to instantiate the class.  Simply call the functions as
 * static functions; e.g.,MemoryUtilities::function(...).
