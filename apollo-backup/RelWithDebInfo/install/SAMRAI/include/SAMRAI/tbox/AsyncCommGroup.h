/*!
 * @brief Supports all-to-one and one-to-all asynchronous
 * communication operations within a given group of processes by
 * sending messages along the branches of a conceptual tree.
 *
 * This class was created to perform certain group communications
 * without using MPI global communications, which require creating new
 * MPI communicators (can be expensive) and does not support
 * asynchronous operations (until MPI-2).
 *
 * The supported communications are asynchronous in that you can start
 * one and wait for it or check back on it occassionally until it
 * completes.  Simultaneous Asynchronous operations of many groups can
 * be done by using a AsyncCommStage to allocate the groups and to
 * check for completed communications.
 *
 * Supported operations are currently broadcast, gather and sum
 * reduce.  Only integer data is supported.
 *
 * A tree is an acyclic graph in which a node at position pos has
 * nchild children, and the following positions for its
 *
 * - parent: (pos-1)/nchild
 * - first (oldest) child: pos*nchild+1
 * - last (youngest) child: (pos+1)*nchild
 *
 * For example, nchild=2 corresponds to a binary tree.
 *
 * Communication is done by sending messages toward the root (for
 * all-to-one operations) or leaves (for one-to-all operations).  For
 * the former, we receive data from the children and send to the
 * parent.  For the latter, we receive from the parent and send to the
 * children.  Thus every communication involves a receive and a send
 * (except at the root and leaf nodes of the tree).
 *
 * Using a tree generally gives better performance than having all
 * processes in the the tree communicate directly with the root
 * process.  Using MPI communicators corresponding to the groups may
 * faster than using this class, but the cost of creating MPI
 * communicators MAY be expensive.
 *
 * This class supports communication and uses MPI for message passing.
 * If MPI is disabled, the job of this class disappears and the class
 * is effectively empty.  The public interfaces still remain so the
 * class can compile, but the implementations are trivial.
