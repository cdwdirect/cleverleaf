Where to report Bugs
--------------------

If a bug is found in the SAMRAI library, we ask that you kindly report
it to us so that we may fix it.  LLNL users may report bugs using the
LLNL Sourceforge site if you have a sourceforge account:

https://sourceforge.llnl.gov/sf/tracker/do/listTrackers/projects.samrai/tracker

Bugs found by other users should send email to samrai-bugs@llnl.gov.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Significant bug fixes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Fixed bug in making a refined/coarsened hierarchy when there are periodic
   directions.  The bug led to wrong periodic shifts in the created hierarchy.

2) Fixed bug that led to non-nesting or bad levels.  The occurance of this
   symptom is extremely rare but can happen during GriddingAlgorithm's
   box manipulations.

3) Error checking has been added to ensure that transpose pairs of Connectors
   have consistent Connector widths.  If both levels connected by the
   Connectors are at the level of mesh resolution, the transpose
   Connectors must have identical Connector widths.  If the levels are at
   different levels of resolution, the Connector widths must be consistent
   such that refining the width associated with the coarser level will
   yield the width associated with the finer level.

Bug fix in v. 3.9.1:

4) A bug has been fixed that caused incorrect computations of periodic shifts
   when different grid geometries of different sizes were used in the same
   application.  Now periodic shifts are computed using a PeriodicShiftCatalog
   object that is unique to each grid geometry and can be retrieved using
   BaseGridGeometry::getPeriodicShiftCatalog().  This bug fix required a change
   to the interfaces of one constructor of class Box and one overloaded
   version of Box::initialize().

                Summary of what's new
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section contains a summary of additions to SAMRAI.  More detailed
descriptions of items in the following list are provided below.

1) Formalized the value type of tbox::Dimension with a typedef.

2) VisItDataWriter::packRegularAndDerivedData now takes a simulation time.
   This is useful when the derived data is a function of time.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Summary of what's changed
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section contains a summary of changes to SAMRAI.  More detailed
descriptions of items in the following list are provided below.

1) Type returned for cell counts changed from int to size_t.

2) BalanceUtilities::gatherAndReportLoadBalance changed to
   BalanceUtilities::reduceAndReportLoadBalance.

3) BaseGridGeometry::getNeighbors() has been replaced by iterators over the
   neighbors accessed by begin(), end(), and find().

4) The non-const versions of Box::upper() and Box::lower() have been replaced
   by Box::setUpper() and Box::setLower().


*****************************************************************************

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Details about what's new
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Dimension::getValue has been returning an unsigned short.  This type has
   been formalized with the typedef Dimension::dir_t.



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Details about what's changed
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Cell counts, as returned by methods such as Box::size, Box::offset, etc.
   changed from int to size_t.  This was done in order to prevent integer
   overflows for huge boxes.

2) BalanceUtilities::gatherAndReportLoadBalance changed to
   BalanceUtilities::reduceAndReportLoadBalance and uses a reduce instead of
   a gather for faster completion.  The gathered data wasn't useful anyway.

3) BaseGridGeometry::getNeighbors() exposed the implementation of the storage
   of each block's neighbors.  It has been replaced by NeighborIterator and
   ConstNeighborIterator which iterate over the neighbors of a block.  The
   method begin(const BlockId&) returns an iterator pointing to the first
   Neighbor of the block with the supplied BlockId.  Similarly,
   end(const BlockId&) returns an iterator pointing one past the last neighbor
   of the block with the supplied BlockId.  find(const BlockId&, const BlockId&)
   returns an iterator pointing to the Neighbor with the 2nd BlockId of the the
   block with the 1st BlockId or end() if there is no such Neighbor.

4) Makes the places where Boxes are being modified explicit.
