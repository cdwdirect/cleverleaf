                Summary of what's new
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Boost is now required for building SAMRAI.

(2) BlockId, identifying a block within a multiblock mesh, is now part of the 
MappedBoxId.

(3) Transformation class added, to handle transformation between
coordinate systems of different blocks.

This section contains a summary of additions to SAMRAI.  More detailed
descriptions of items in the following list are provided below.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Summary of what's changed
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Many interfaces specifying components of a MappedBoxId have been
extended to include the new BlockId component of the MappedBoxId.

(2) MultiblockPatchHierarchy and MultiblockPatchLevel have been removed,
with PatchHierarchy and PatchLevel now able to represent multiblock meshes.

(3) GridGeometry is no longer an abstract base class.  It can be constructed
directly for applications that manage their own grid locations and need only
to have a GridGeometry object manage SAMRAI's coordinate systems.

(4) GridGeometry holds the multiblock metadata that previously had been
held in MutliblockPatchHierarchy.

(5) MultiblockRefineAlgorithm, MultiblockRefineSchedule and
MultiblockRefinePatchStrategy have been removed, and RefineSchedule and
RefineAlgorithm can handle the multiblock communication functionality
formerly done by those classes.

(6) GriddingAlgorithm's check_overlapping_patches flag now defaults to
"WARN".

(7) GriddingAlgorithm::makeCoarsestLevel taking a user-defined
box configuration is removed.

(8) MultiblockGriddingAlgorithm is removed.

(9) MappedBox and MappedBoxId ordering has changed.

(10) Neighbor look-ups in Connectors now uses MappedBoxId.

(11) BaseGriddingAlgorithm is renamed to GriddingAlgorithmStrategy.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Details about what's new
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Boost is now required for building SAMRAI.

Boost is required to build SAMRAI.   We have tested against boost/1.45.0.

Boost is available at www.boost.org.

Use the --with-boost=<directory> configure option to specify the path to 
the boost install.


(2) BlockId, identifying a block within a multiblock mesh, is now part of the
MappedBoxId.

The BlockId is used to specify a block for a MappedBoxId, a MappedBox, or
a Patch.

(3) Transformation class added, to handle transformations between
coordinate systems of different blocks.

The Transformation class uses a RotationIdentifier and an offset IntVector
to describe the transformation between blocks.  The BoxOverlap child classes
in the pdat package now hold a Transformation, which allows transactions
(copy, packStream, unpackStream) to be constructed between patches on
different blocks.  The Transformation is also used to hold the offset
for transactions across periodic boundaries, in which case the rotation is
always null and the offset is the shift from one side of the periodic domain
to the other.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Details about what's changed
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Many interfaces specifying components of a MappedBoxId have been
extended to include the new BlockId component of the MappedBoxId.

Among changed interfaces are the MappedBoxId and MappedBox constructors.
NeighborhoodSets now key on the MappedBoxId instead of the GlobalId.
MappedBoxLevel interfaces for adding, removing and finding MappedBoxes
now include the BlockId.

(2) MultiblockPatchHierarchy and MultiblockPatchLevel have been removed,
with PatchHierarchy and PatchLevel now able to represent multiblock meshes.

PatchLevel now contains Patches that can exist on any block in the multiblock
configuration.  Given a Patch, the block where it exists can be queries by
calling the getMappedBox method and checking the BlockId of the returned
MappedBox.

The full multiblock AMR hierarchy is now represented by a single PatchHierarchy
which holds an array of multiblock-aware PatchLevels.

(3) GridGeometry is no longer an abstract base class.  It can be constructed
directly for applications that manage their own grid locations and need only
to have a GridGeometry object manage SAMRAI's coordinate systems.              

Direct construction of GridGeometry is recommended for multiblock problems,
and can also be used for single-block applications that keep track of grid
locations inside of user code.  

CartesianGridGeometry remains as a derived class of GridGeometry for use
by applications that require Cartesian grids.

(4) GridGeometry holds the multiblock metadata that previously had been
held in MutliblockPatchHierarchy.

The metadata for multiblock grids, describing the relationships between
coordinate systems of neighboring blocks, and describing the locations of
reduced and enhanced connectivity, now exists in GridGeometry.  The input
format for setting up this metadata remains the same, and GridGeometry
also has a number of methods for accessing information about this metadata.

(5) MultiblockRefineAlgorithm, MultiblockRefineSchedule and
MultiblockRefinePatchStrategy have been removed, and RefineSchedule and
RefineAlgorithm can handle the multiblock communication functionality
formerly done by those classes.

Additionally, fillSingularityBoundaryConditions, which was a pure virtual
method in MultiblockRefinePatchStrategy providing a user interface for
filling ghost data at reduced or enhanced connectivity locations, has now
been moved to RefinePatchStrategy as a virtual method.  It has a default
no-op implementation, so that single-block user code need not add an
implementation, but it should be overridden in multiblock user code to 
handle ghost data at such singularities.  Some of the arguments have also
changed from the version that was in MultiblockRefinePatchStrategy.

(6) GriddingAlgorithm's check_overlapping_patches flag now defaults to
"WARN".

This change is meant to spare applications that can tolerate overlapping
patches from an unneeded error while giving a fair warning to users of
applications that cannot tolerate overlapping patches.

(7) GriddingAlgorithm::makeCoarsestLevel taking a user-defined
box configuration is removed.

The capability for users to build the coarsest level with a given
configuration can be done on other ways.  Users can specify a specific
partitioner for level 0 that generates the desired configuration or
build the coarsest level manually using PatchHierarchy::removePatchLevel
and makeNewPatchLevel.

(8) MultiblockGriddingAlgorithm is removed.

GriddingAlgorithm now supports multiblock hierarchies.

(9) MappedBox and MappedBoxId ordering has changed.

MappedBoxes and MappedBoxIds used to be ordered so that objects with
the same BlockId are grouped together.  They are now ordered so that
those with owner ranks are grouped together.  Within a group with
the same owner ranks, those with the same BlockIds are grouped together.

(10) Neighbor look-ups in Connectors now uses MappedBoxId.

These look-ups used to take GlobalIds.  That does not work for multiblock
because GlobalIds lack the BlockId data.

(11) BaseGriddingAlgorithm is renamed to GriddingAlgorithmStrategy.

This conforms better to SAMRAI naming standards.
