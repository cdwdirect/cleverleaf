                     Release Notes for SAMRAI v2.1.0
     (notes for previous releases may be found in /SAMRAI/docs/release)
*****************************************************************************

NOTE:  These release notes are more descriptive and detailed than is usual
       for software release notes.  The reason for this is that presently
       complete documentation does not exist for most of the items listed.
       Until sufficient user documentation becomes available, descriptions
       such as those that follow will be part of SAMRAI release notes.

Please direct any questions related to these notes to the SAMRAI development
team by sending email to samrai@llnl.gov.

Where to report Bugs
--------------------

If a bug is found in the SAMRAI library, we ask that you kindly report it
to us so that we may fix it.  We will make every effort to fix bugs
in a timely manner.  Depending on the severity or the complexity of the
bug, we will either fix the bug for a subsequent library release or send
a code fix to users so that their work is minimally interrupted.

LLNL users should report bugs using the CASC bug tracking web pages:

        http://www-casc.llnl.gov/bugs/

Enter the bug into the appropriate area of the SAMRAI project section.

Bugs found by other users should send email to samrai-bugs@llnl.gov.

                Summary of what's changed
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section contains a summary of changes to SAMRAI.  More detailed 
descriptions of items in the following list are provided below.

(1) The hypre library has changed slightly, affecting SAMRAI's cell-centered
Poisson solver codes.  Our solvers require hypre-1.9.0b or later.

(2) The "femutils"  directory was moved from the solvers package to the
algorithms package.  Any instances of patch boundary sum objects
must be declared in the algs namespace.

(3) Support for time interpolation in communication schedules that treat 
locally-active patch data has been added.  As a result the interfaces and
usage of the locally-active patch data communication algorithms and schedules
is essentially the same as in the standard case, where patch data lives on
all patches in an AMR patch hierarchy.

                Summary of what's new
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section contains a summary of additions to SAMRAI.  More detailed 
descriptions of items in the following list are provided below.

(1) New classes added to the multiblock package

(2) Added support for embedded and immersed boundary applications.

(3) Added option to set summary filename in VisItDataWriter.

(4) restart-redistribute tool added to allow for restart on arbirtrary
    numbers of processors.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Details about what's changed
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Older versions of hypre required that we specify periodic boundary
conditions using boolean flags.  This interface has been changed, now
requiring the periodic shifts instead.  The cell-centered Poisson solver
in SAMRAI has been changed to conform to this new interface.  Unfortunately,
it makes our solver incompatible with older versions of hypre.  We have
tested with hypre-1.9.0b and we recommend that you upgrade to this version
if you wish to use hypre.

(2) The "femutils"  directory was moved from the solvers package to the
algorithms package.  Any instances of patch boundary sum objects
must be declared in the algs namespace. For example, the reference for
PatchBoundaryNodeSum is now in the "algs" rather than "solv" namespace:
   OLD:  solv::PatchBoundaryNodeSum<NDIM>
   NEW:  algs::PatchBoundaryNodeSum<NDIM>


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Details about what's new
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Some new classes were added to the multiblock package, including 
MultiblockRefinePatchStrategy and  MultiblockCoarsenPatchStrategy. A number
of other design changes were also made to more easily support multiblock
applications.

(2) Support for embedded and immersed boundary applications was added 
to the apputils package, in the directory apputils/embedded_boundary.
The class EmbeddedBoundaryGeometry manages construction and data manipulation
of embedded boundaries on a Cartesian mesh. See header comments for details
of the ways in which these classes may be used.  We also added links
to outside packages - Cart3D and Eleven/Overture - for complex geometry
grid generation.  These classes are currently empty due to licensing issues,
but feel free to send a message to samrai@llnl.gov if you are interested
in using them and we may be able to work around the license restrictions.

(3) By default the summary file written by the VisItDataWriter was 
hardwired to be called "summary.samrai".  Some users expressed the desire
to change its name so we added a new method VisItDataWriter::setSummaryFilename()
that allows the user to change the name of the file. To identify the 
samrai file to VisIt, the filename must still end in ".samrai" (so the
actual filename will be <filename>.samrai, where <filename> is what
you supply).

(4) The restart-redistribute tool has been created to allow for restarted
runs on an arbitrary number of processors.  Ordinarily, SAMRAI's restart
files require all restarted runs use the same number of processors as the run
that created the restart dump.  This tool processes a restart directory and
creates a new set of restart files for use on a different number of processors.
See the README in the tools/restart directory for instructions on the
building and usage of this tool.

                Major Bug Fixes 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Problems with communication of "edge" patch data on a periodic domain
have been fixed.  In particular, this fixes a problem with the patch boundary
node sum utilities.
