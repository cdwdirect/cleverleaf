  @page package_patchdata_operators_time_interpolate Time Interpolation Operators

  Standard time interpolation operators are provided here for each of the
  SAMRAI array-based patch data types.  These operators interpolate linearly
  in time between two patch data objects to another patch data object
  whose data corresponds to an intermediate time between the times associated
  with the two sources.  Typically, time interpolation is required to fill 
  ghost cell data around patches from data on a coarser level.  During the 
  course of integrating a time-dependent problem over an AMR mesh hierarchy, 
  the times associated with data on successive levels may be different. 
  Each operator defined for a data centering (e.g., cell, face, node)
  and data type (e.g., double, float, complex) is implemented in a separate
  class.  Each concrete operator class is derived from the abstract operator
  base class in the <EM>transfer</EM> package.  The actual time interpolation
  numerical routines are implemented in FORTRAN.

  In the interest of brevity, we include header file documentation for
  a single time interpolation operator.  This operator is representative of 
  the interface for every other time interpolation operator class in the 
  patchdata package. For reference, we note that linear time interpolation 
  operators are provided for cell-centered, face-centered, edge-centered,
  node-centered, side-centered, outerface, and outerside patch data types 
  where the data may be complex, double, or float.
  All operators have the string identifier "STD_LINEAR_TIME_INTERPOLATE".
  The purpose of the name string is to distinguish these operators from others
  that may be added in the future.  The string need not be specified to look
  up time interpolation operators at this time.  It is important to note that 
  new time interpolation operators may be added at any time without 
  re-compilation of the patchdata package or SAMRAI library code.
