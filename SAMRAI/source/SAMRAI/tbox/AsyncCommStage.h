/*!
 * @brief Stage multiple non-blocking MPI communications so that codes
 * waiting for them to complete can advance as their respective MPI
 * communication operations are completed.
 *
 * An AsyncCommStage object manages multiple non-blocking MPI
 * communications carried out by AsyncCommStage::Member objects.
 * These classes factor out multiple non-blocking communication codes.
 *
 * By being staged together, Members can overlap their communication
 * waits conveniently.  The stage determines which Member's
 * communication requests are completed.  User code then follows up
 * the communication with whatever was waiting for that operation to
 * complete.
 *
 * The Member class defines the interfaces required to work with an
 * AsyncCommStage.  Communication operations can be a simple
 * non-blocking MPI communication or a complex sequence of MPI
 * communications and local computations.  See Member subclasses for
 * examples.
 *
 * Use this class when you:
 * - Have multiple communications, each performed
 *   by a different and independent AsyncCommStage::Member object.
 * - Want the multiple communications to proceed
 *   independently and asynchronously.
 *
 * Each AsyncCommStage is a registry of Member objects on the stage.
 * To overlap the Members' communications, the stage manages space for
 * their SAMRAI_MPI::Request's and SAMRAI_MPI::Status'es.  The
 * requests are allocated such that a single MPI_Waitany or
 * MPI_Waitsome represents all Members registered with the stage.
 * Thus the communications performed by the Member objects can
 * complete in the order allowed by the arrival of MPI messages.  The
 * exact order is NOT deterministic!
 *
 * To advance the communication operation of any of the allocated
 * Member objects, use advanceAny() or advanceSome().  In general,
 * advanceSome() has better performance than advanceAny() because it
 * avoids the "starvation" problem.  See the MPI documentation for a
 * discussion of starvation.
 *
 * This class supports communication and uses MPI for message passing.
 * If MPI is disabled, the job of this class disappears and the class
 * is effectively empty, except for managing the registration of
 * Member objects.  The public interfaces still remain so the class
 * can compile, but the implementations are trivial.
