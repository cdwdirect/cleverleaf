/*!
 * Class TimerManager is a Singleton class that manages a list of
 * timer objects to do performance analysis in SAMRAI library modules
 * and application codes built with SAMRAI.
 *
 * Typically, entries in the input file guide timer invocation and
 * output generation.  Within the source code, timer objects are retrieved
 * as follows:
 *
 *    std::shared_ptr<Timer> name_timer =
 *        TimerManager::getManager->getTimer("name");
 *
 * Here `name' is the name string identifier for the timer.
 *
 * <b> Input Parameters </b>
 *
 * <b> Definitions: </b>
 *    - \b    print_exclusive
 *       Specifies whether to track and print exclusive times.  Exclusive
 *       times are convenient for identifying time spent inside nested
 *       routines.  This option should be used with some discretion because
 *       the extra overhead to manage the nested list of timers is between
 *       four and seven times more expensive than doing simple start/stop
 *       operations (as is done with the print_total option).  For this
 *       reason, we leave it off by default.
 *
 *    - \b    print_total
 *       Specifies whether to print total (i.e. non-nested) time.  This is
 *       the least expensive way to time parts of the code.  The overhead
 *       associated with each start/stop sequence is about one-half a
 *       millionth of a second.
 *
 *    - \b    print_processor
 *       Print times measured on individual processors.
 *
 *    - \b    print_max
 *       Print maximum time spent on any processor, and the processor ID
 *       that incurred the time.
 *
 *    - \b    print_summed
 *       Print time summed across all processors.
 *
 *    - \b    print_user
 *       Print user time (measured by system clock).
 *
 *    - \b    print_sys
 *       Print system time (measured by system clock).
 *
 *    - \b    print_wall
 *       Print wallclock time.
 *
 *    - \b    print_percentage
 *       Prints the percentage of total time with each timer.
 *
 *    - \b    print_concurrent
 *       Prints the concurrent timer tree, as determined during exclusive
 *       timing.  That is, for each timer, it prints the list of names of
 *       the timers in nested routines it calls.
 *
 *    - \b    print_timer_overhead
 *       Prints some overhead stats associated with the timers.  Information
 *       like the number of times a start/stop sequence was called for the
 *       timer, and the predicted overhead time associated with the timer.
 *       This is a convenient option to occasionally check to make sure the
 *       timers themselves are not affecting the performance of your
 *       calculation.
 *
 *    - \b    print_threshold
 *       Timers that use up less than (<EM>print_threshold</EM>) percent of
 *       the overall run time are not printed.  This can be a convenient
 *       option to limit output if you have many timers invoked.
 *
 *    - \b    timer_list
 *       List of timers to be invoked.  The timers can be listed individually
 *       in <TT>package::class::method</TT> format or the entries may contain
 *       wildcards to turn on a set of timers in a given package or class: <br>
 *       timer_list = "pkg1::*::*", "pkg2::class2::*", ...

 *
 * TimerManager expects timer names to be in a certain format to preserve
 * the wildcard naming capability (i.e. to turn on entire package or class
 * of timers).  See the PDF document in
 * /SAMRAI/docs/userdocs/Timing-Instrumentation.pdf for a discussion of how
 * to add timers that maintain this format as well as a catalog of available
 * timers currently implemented in the library.
 *
 * Timing recursive function calls will yeild erroneous results and
 * may lead to memory problems.  We recommend {\em not to use timers
 * to time recursive function calls}.
