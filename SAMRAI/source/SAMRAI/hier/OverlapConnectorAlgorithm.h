    *
    * The "bridge" is the Connectors between @c west and @c east.
    * Bridging is an algorithm for finding their overlaps using
    * existing overlaps incident from @c center.  This is more
    * efficient than findOverlaps() because it does not require
    * acquiring, storing or searching globalized data.
    *
    * Preconditions:
    *
    * - Four input Connectors refer to the center BoxLevel, two
    * refer to the west, and two refer to the east.  The center, east
    * and west BoxLevels must be the same regardless of what
    * Connector is used to get them.  For example, <tt>
    * &west_to_center.getTranspose().getHead() == &west_to_center.getBase() </tt> must
    * be true.
    *
    * Postconditions:
    *
    * @li @c west and @c east, as referenced by the output Connectors
    * are heads of west_to_center's transpose and @c center_to_east.
    *
    * @li Widths of the output Connectors will be either @c
    * center_to_east's width reduced by @c center_growth_to_nest_west
    * or west_to_center's transpose's width reduced by @c
    * center_growth_to_nest_east, which ever is greater.  Output
    * Connector widths are still limited by the @c
    * connector_width_limit argument.  All comparisons are done after
    * the appropriate index space conversions, of course.
    *
    * @note
    *
    * @li Although @c east, @c west and @c center are not explicit
    * parameters, they are specified implicitly through the input
    * Connectors.
    *
    * @li The bridge operation works in the degenerate case where @c
    * east and @c west are the same object.  In that case, @c
    * west_to_east and its transpose should also be the same object.
    *
    * @li Bridging finds as many overlaps as it can, given the inputs,
    * but can only guarantee that the output Connectors are complete
    * overlap Connectors if there is nesting as specified by the
    * arguments @c center_growth_to_nest_west and/or @c
    * center_growth_to_nest_east.  Nesting is not checked, because
    * checking requires an iterative non-scalable computation.
    * Nesting is best determined by the code that created the
    * BoxLevels involved.  Bridging is meant to be fast and
    * scalable.
    *
    * @li Periodic relationships are automatically generated if a head
    * Box in its shifted position overlaps the grown base Box.
    * However, because neighbors may be remote, we cannot scalably
    * verify that the periodic neighbors actually exist in the heads
    * of the output Connectors.  Spurious periodic relationships may
    * be generated when the periodic image simply has not be added to
    * the head or when parts of east or west lie outside the domain
    * extents.  They can be discarded using
    * Connector::removePeriodicRelationships and properly regenerated
    * using BoxLevelConnectorUtils.

    * @param[in] center_to_east
    *
    * @param center_growth_to_nest_west The amount by which the center
    * BoxLevel must grow to nest the west BoxLevel.
    * Bridging guarantees completeness if the width of @b
    * center_to_east exceeds this amount.  If unknown, set to negative
    * value if unknown so it won't be considered when computing the
    * output Connector widths.
    *
    * @param center_growth_to_nest_east The amount by which the center
    * BoxLevel must grow to nest the east BoxLevel.
    * Bridging guarantees completeness if the width of @b
    * west_to_center's transpose exceeds this amount.  If unknown, set to
    * negative value if unknown so it won't be considered when computing the

    * width to compute overlaps for.  The connector_width should be in
