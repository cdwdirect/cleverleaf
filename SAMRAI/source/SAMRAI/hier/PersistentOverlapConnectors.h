/*!
 * @brief A managager of overlap Connectors incident from a
 * BoxLevel, used to store and, if needed, generate overlap
 * Connectors in BoxLevel.
 *
 * PersistantOverlapConnectors provides a mechanism for objects using
 * the BoxLevel to look up overlap Connectors for the
 * BoxLevel.  Connectors created or returned by this class are
 * complete overlap Connectors that always contain the correct overlap
 * neighbor data.
 *
 * For improved scalability, Connectors can be constructed externally
 * and copied into the collection.  Connectors can also be
 * automatically computed using a non-scalable global search.
 *
 * <b> Input Parameters </b>
 *
 * <b> Definitions: </b>
 *
 *    - \b implicit_connector_creation_rule
 *      How to proceed when findConnector() cannot find any suitable overlap
 *      Connector.  Values can be "ERROR", "WARN" (default) or "SILENT".  If
 *      "SILENT", silently get a globalized version of the head BoxLevel and
 *      look for overlaps.  If "WARN", do the same thing but write a warning to
 *      the log.  If "ERROR", exit with an error.
 *
 * <b> Details: </b> <br>
 * <table>
 *   <tr>
 *     <th>parameter</th>
 *     <th>type</th>
 *     <th>default</th>
 *     <th>range</th>
 *     <th>opt/req</th>
 *     <th>behavior on restart</th>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td>implicit_connector_creation_rule</td>
 *     <td>string</td>
 *     <td>"WARN"</td>
 *     <td>"ERROR", "WARN", "SILENT"</td>
 *     <td>opt</td>
 *     <td>Not read from restart</td>
 *   </tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * @note Creating overlap Connectors by global search is not scalable
 * Nevertheless, the default for implicit_connector_creation_rule is "WARN",
 * so that application development need not worry about missing overlap
 * Connectors.  To selectively enable automatic Connector generation, set this
 * input paramter to "ERROR" and call findConnector() with "CREATE" where you
 * are unsure if the Connector has been created.
