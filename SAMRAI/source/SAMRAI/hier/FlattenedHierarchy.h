/*!
 * @brief A flattened representation of a hierarchy.
 *
 * Class FlattenedHierarchy provides a way to view a PatchHierarchy or a
 * subset of levels of PatchHierarchy in a "flattened" representation.  In
 * this representation, only the finest existing mesh is visible at any given
 * location in the problem space.
 *
 * For any Patch in a PatchHierarchy, an associated container of visible boxes
 * is created.  If the Patch has no Patches from a finer level covering any
 * of its index space, then the container will simply hold a box that is
 * spatially equivalent to the Patch itself.  If the Patch's index space is
 * entirely covered by Patches on a finer level, the container will be empty.
 * If the Patch's index space is partially covered by a finer level, then
 * the container will hold boxes that compose the uncovered parts of the Patch.
