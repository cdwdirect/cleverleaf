    * MappingConnectors.
    *
    * The change is represented by a the mapper @c old_to_new
    * and its transpose, new_to_old.  The Connectors to be
    * modified are @c anchor_to_mapped and its transpose mapped_to_anchor,
    * which on input, go between an anchor (not mapped) BoxLevel and the old
    * BoxLevel.  On output, these Connectors will go from the anchor box_level
    * to the new box_level.
    *
    * @code
    * Input:
    *
    *                                    (anchor)
    *                                   ^ /
    *                                  / /

    *                               / v
    * mapped box_level:           (old) ---------> (new)
    *                                   <---------
    *
    *
    * Output:
    *
    *                                    (anchor)
    *                                          \ ^
    *                                           \ \
    *                                            \ \ <-mapped_to_anchor
    *                        anchor_to_mapped --> \ \
    *                                              v \

    *
    * The BoxLevels before and after the mapping are represented
    * by the base and head of the mapping.  No BoxLevel is modified,
    * other than the "mutable" BoxLevels in the argument.
    *
    * An important constraint in the old_to_new MappingConnectors is
    * that this method cannot handle multiple maps at once.  For
    * example, it cannot map box J to box K and at the
    * same time map box I to box J.  Box J in the
    * old box_level and box J on the new
    * box_level are considered entirely different boxes.
    *
    * After modifying, the output Connectors that had referenced old
    * BoxLevels will be reset to reference the new
    * BoxLevel.  This is the end of the modify operation.
    *
    * The following "in-place" modification is provided for users'
    * convenience.  Often times, the "new" level is a temporary object
    * and users often reset output equivalent to:
    *
    * @li old = new
    * @li reset Connectors using old in place of new.
    *
    * The modify methods support these optional steps as follows: If
    * mutable versions of some BoxLevel are given, the output
    * Connectors can be reset to reference these versions instead.
    *
    * If mutable_new points to the old BoxLevel and mutable_old
    * points to the new, then do an in-place switch as follows:
    * @li Swap the mutable_old and mutable_new BoxLevels.
    * @li Use mutable_old (which actually the new BoxLevel after
    *    the swap) as the mapped BoxLevel in the output Connectors.
    * Otherwise:
    * @li If mutable_new is non-NULL, set it equal to new and use
    *    it as the mapped BoxLevel in the output Connectors.
    * @li If mutable_old is non-NULL, set it equal to the old BoxLevel.
    *
    * @param[in,out] anchor_to_mapped Connector to be modified.  On input, this
    *   points to the BoxLevel being mapped.
    * @param[in] old_to_new Mapping from the old BoxLevel to the
    *   new BoxLevel.
    *   The width of old-->new should indicate the maximum amount of box
    *   growth caused by the change.  A value of zero means no growth.
    * @param[in,out] mutable_new See comments.
    * @param[in,out] mutable_old See comments.
