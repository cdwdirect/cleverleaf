/**
 * Class StandardTagAndInitStrategy is an abstract base class
 * that defines a Strategy pattern interface for concrete cell tagging
 * and level initialization operations that are needed by the
 * StandardTagAndInitialize class.  This base class insulates
 * that algorithm class from routines for initializing a new level in
 * the hierarchy and for tagging cells to be refined.  Generally, these
 * operations are specific to the problem being solved and the solution
 * methods being employed.  An object of this type is passed into the
 * StandardTagAndInitialize constructor.
 *
 * This base class has two pure virtual functions:
 * initializeLevelData(), and resetHierarchyConfiguration() that must
 * be implemented for any regridding method.  The first function sets
 * data on a new level after regridding.  The second function is called
 * at the end of the regridding process and can be used to set communication
 * schedules, for example, which depend on the configuration of the AMR
 * patch hierarchy.  Other routines are virtual here and given default
 * implementations as they are specific to only one type of error estimation
 * method.  Gradient detector functionality requires an implementation of
 * the applyGradientDetector() routine.  The Richardson extrapolation method
 * requires implementations of the methods: applyRichardsonExtrapolation(),
 * coarsenDataForRichardsonExtrapolation(), getLevelDt(), advanceLevel(),
 * resetTimeDependentData(), and resetDataToPreadvanceState().
 *
 * @see StandardTagAndInitialize.
