  @page package_mesh_load_balance Load Balancing

  These classes are used to determine a how the set of patches on each
  patch level in an AMR hierarchy is built and how those patches will
  be distributed across processors on a parallel machine.  Given a collection
  of boxes whose union represents the domain of a level, these routines 
  construct another set of boxes and a mapping of each box to a processor.
  The new hierarchy level will be constructed using this information.
  In other words, the load balance routines attempt to distribute work
  across processors according to a set of prescribed parameters.  Currently 
  available routines use spatially-uniform and non-uniform workload 
  distributions.  For a spatially-uniform work distribution, the workload 
  estimate for each box is proportional to the number of cells in the box.  
  For the non-uniform work distribution routines, the workload is determined
  by the user who specifies a numerical value for each cell (e.g., the 
  amount of work needed to update the solution in the cell).  In addition, 
  load balancing routines attempt to assign patches near each other in 
  space to the same processor when possible.
