 * @brief Class VisDerivedDataStrategy is an abstract base class
 * that defines an interface allowing an VisItDataWriter object
 * to generate plot files that contain "derived" quantities; that
 * is, data that does not reside on the hierarchy, but which is
 * derived from data that does reside on the hierarchy.  The
 * derived data may be scalar, vector, or tensor, and cell-centered
 * or node-centered.  A concrete object of this type must be
 * registered with the data writer if any derived variable is
 * registered with the data writer.  The registration of the
 * concrete strategy object may be done independently using the
 * method setDefaultDerivedDataWriter() from the relevant DataWriter
 * class, or the concrete strategy object may be registered
 * concurrently with the derived variable using the method
 * registerDerivedPlotScalar/Vector/Tensor().
 *
 * The concrete strategy object is responsible for supplying an
 * implementation of the function packDerivedDataIntoDoubleBuffer()
 * which calculates the derived data and writes it into the double
 * precision buffer passed in to it.

    * @brief This function calculates and packs derived
    * cell-centered data to a 1D double precision buffer.  In the case
    * of the VisIt data writer, node-centered data may also be used.
    * It is called once for each component of multicomponent data.
    *
    * The buffer will be already allocated.  This routine is needed to
    * construct data values that are not stored on the hierarchy, but
    * which may be important to visualize.  The data to be packed
    * corresponds to the plot variable that the user has registered
    * with the data writer using
    * registerDerivedPlotScalar/Vector/Tensor() with the std::string
    * "variable_name".  The data to be packed is derived from the data
    * that lives on the given patch.  The box describes the patch
    * region over which to pack the data.  It is assumed that all data
    * needed to compute the derived quantity exists on the given
    * patch.
    *
    * The method packDerivedDataIntoDoubleBuffer() will be called DIM
    * times for vector data, and DIM*DIM times for tensor data, with
    * the integer "depth_index" argument indicating the particular
    * component of vector to be packed.  For scalar values, the
    * depth_index will be 0.
    *
    * This routine must include ghost data if the ghost_cell_width
    * parameter was set when the derived data was registered. The data
    * must be packed into the buffer in column major order, the
    * ordering used by SAMRAI, i.e. (f(x_0,y_0,z_0), f(x_1,y_0,z_0),
    * f(x_2,y_0,z_0), ...). If the derived data was registered as
    * node-centered, a buffer of node-centered data is expected.
    * Derived data need not be defined on all patches.  It is the
    * responsibility of this routine to determine if data exists on
    * the patch and set the return value of of this routine
    * appropriately: true if the data exists on the patch, false
    * otherwise.
    *
    * @param buffer Double precision array into which derived data is
    *  packed.
    * @param patch hier::Patch on which to calculate and pack derived data.
    * @param region hier::Box region over which to pack data.
    * @param variable_name Name identifier for the derived variable as
    *  registered in registerDerivedPlotScalar/Vector/Tensor().
    * @param depth_index For scalar quantities index will be zero.
    *  For vector data, index varies between 0 and DIM-1.  For tensor
    *  data, index varies from 0 (DIM*DIM)-1.
    * @param simulation_time Optional argument specifying the double
    *    precision simulation time. Default is 0.0.
    * @return Boolean value indicating if derived data defined on this
    *  patch.
