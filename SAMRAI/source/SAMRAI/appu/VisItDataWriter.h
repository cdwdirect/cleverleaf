 * @brief Class VisItDataWriter is used by SAMRAI-based
 * application codes to generate VisIt data files.  VisIt provides a
 * wide range of visualization and post-processing capabilities.  This
 * class supports both cell-centered and node-centered 2D and 3D AMR
 * data where the underlying data type is either double, float, or
 * int.  Scalar, vector and 2nd-order tensor variables are
 * supported. This class may be used when the mesh geometry is managed
 * by a geom::CartesianGridGeometry object, or when the mesh itself is
 * stored in a state variable to allow moving deformed grids.
 *
 * The VisIt data writer (VDW) supports CELL or NODE centered data
 * of data type double, float, and integer.  There is support to
 * convert an alternative user-defined type into standard cell or node
 * centered data for visualization purposes.  See method descriptions
 * below for more information.  The data actually written by the VDW
 * is of type float so data should not exceed the defined MAX_FLT
 * and/or MIN_FLT.  An optional scale factor may be supplied for
 * data that exceeds these values.
 *
 * After creating a VDW object, the data items to be dumped for
 * plotting must be registered with that object. Thereafter, the
 * object can be used to generate a series of visualization dump files
 * during the execution of an application.  The dumps will include all
 * data items registered with the VDW.
 *
 * This class supports the dumping of data that
 * resides on an AMR patch hierarchy at the time the dump file is
 * written, and derived data, data that does not live on the patch
 * hierarchy, but that can be computed from data which does live on
 * the patch hierarchy.  Derived data requires the user to implement a
 * method for a concrete class derived from the
 * VisDerivedDataStrategy abstract class.
 *
 * The class also supports writing material and species data.  Material
 * is data which indicates for each cell, the fractional amount of
 * a material compound, e.g. "steel", "gas", "copper", etc., contained
 * in that cell. Species are subcomponents of a material, e.g. if the material
 * is "gas", it may have subcomponents such as "nitrogen", "oxygen",
 * etc.  To use material data it is necessary for a user to implement
 * the relevant packing methods for a concrete class derived from the
 * VisMaterialsDataStrategy abstract class.
 *
 * The VDW requires the compilation of SAMRAI with the HDF5 library.
 *
 *
 * A brief summary of the basic steps typically involved in using the
 * VDW are:
 *
 *    -  Create a VisIt data writer object, specifying a name for the
 *       object and the name of the directory to contain the visit dump
 *       files.  An optional argument number_procs_per_file, applicable
 *       to parallel runs, sets the number of processors that share a
 *       common dump file.  This can reduce parallel I/O contention.
 *       The default value of this arg is 1.  If the value specified
 *       is greater than the number of processors, then all processors
 *       share a single dump file.
 *
 *    - Register hierarchy variable data fields using
 *      registerPlotQuantity(). The variables registered may be scalar,
 *      vector, or tensor (depth 1, dim, and dim*dim, respectively)
 *      which is specified in the argument list.  All variables require a
 *      string identifier and an index into the patch data array on the
 *      AMR hierarchy. Optionally, a start depth index may be supplied
 *      to plot a single component of a multi-component field (i.e.
 *      a scalar quantity within a vector, or a vector within a tensor).
 *      A scale factor may also optionally be specified. Lastly, for
 *      user-defined data that is not cell or node type, the proper
 *      centering (cell or node) for the data may be supplied.
 *
 *    - If using derived data, set a default user-defined
 *      derived data writer using setDefaultDerivedDataWriter(). A derived
 *      data writer may also optionally be specified in the call to
 *      registerDerivedPlotQuantity(); if so, this derived data writer
 *      will be used for the variable being registered.  If no derived
 *      writer is specified in the registration call, the default
 *      derived data writer will be used.
 *
 *    - Register derived variable data fields using
 *      registerDerivedPlotQuantity().  All derived variables require a string
 *      identifier. Optionally, a VisDerivedDataStrategy object,
 *      a scale factor, and centering and may be specified.  By default
 *      By default, the data is assumed to be cell-centered.
 *
 *    - The resetLevelPlotQuantity() method is provided for cases when a
 *      variable lives at different patch data indices on different
 *      levels.  Invoking this method redefines the patch data array
 *      index for a given variable on a given level that will be
 *      written to a visit dump file.  Before this method is called,
 *      the variable must be registered using registerPlotQuantity() method.
 *
 *    - If using deformed structured AMR grids (moving grids), register
 *      the coordinates of the nodes using the registerNodeCoordinates()
 *      method.
 *
 *    - If using materials, set the user-defined data writer for material
 *      data using setMaterialsDataWriter().  Then register the names of
 *      the materials being used with registerMaterialNames().
 *
 *    - If using species of the materials, register the names of
 *      the species of each material using the registerSpeciesNames() method.
 *
 *    - The writer will generate VisIt dump files when the method
 *      writePlotData() is called.  Minimally, only a hierarchy and the
 *      time step number is needed.  A simulation time can also be
 *      specified which will be included as part of the file
 *      information in the dump
 *
 *    - The document "Generating VisIt Visualization Data Files in
 *      SAMRAI" in the SAMRAI documentation directory
 *      (docs/userdocs/VisIt-writer.pdf) gives in-depth details on the
 *      use of the VDW and materials, as well as example code fragments
 *      showing how the various VisItDataWriter methods can be embedded
 *      in an application.

    * @brief This method registers the names of the species for a
    * material_name with the VisIt data writer.
    *
    * Species are subcomponents of a material. For example, a simulation
    * with 4 materials (e.g. "copper", "gold", "liquid" and "gas") may have
    * one of the materials (e.g. "gas") that is composed of multiple
    * species (e.g. "nitrogen" and "helium"). Each species is associated
    * with a particular material, so it is necessary that the
    * "registerMaterialNames()" method is called before this method.
    *
    * For each species name registered, there is an associated species
    * fraction,  which must be between 0 and 1.0 on each cell. The sum of
    * the species fractions for all species of a given material must
    * equal 1.0 in every cell in which that material appears.  In VisIt,
    * the species fractions for a species can be treated as
    * a scalar field and the usual scalar plot operations applied to
    * the field to show "concentrations".  So, in the example described
    * above, the percentage of nitrogen in the gas can be displayed in a
    * pseudocolor plot.
    *
    * In order to use species with VisIt, the application class
    * needs to inherit from VisMaterialsDataStrategy, an
    * abstract base class which defines an interface for writing out
    * species related fields.  A concrete object of the materials data
    * strategy class is responsible for providing an implementation of the
    * method packSpeciesFractionsIntoDoubleBuffer() to write out
    * the species fractions field for each registered species over a
    * given patch.
    *
    * An error results and the program will halt if:
    *   - this method is called before registerMaterialNames() is
    *     called.
    *   - the supplied material name is not in the list of materials
    *     supplied in the registerMaterialNames() method.
    *   - the method is called more than once for a given material
    *   - when assertion checking is active, the number of names = 0,
    *     or any name string is empty.
    *
    * @param material_name String name of the material whose species
    *    names are being registered.
