 * @brief Class VisMaterialsDataStrategy is an abstract base
 * class that defines an interface allowing an VisItDataWriter
 * object to generate plot files that contain material and species
 * fractions, as well as state variables for individual materials.  A
 * concrete object of this type must be registered with the data
 * writer in order to use materials or species with the data writer.
 * The registration of the concrete object is done using the method
 * setMaterialsDataWriter() from the VisItDataWriter class.  VisIt
 * requires that material fractions, species fractions, and material
 * state variables be cell-centered.  If they are not cell-centered in
 * the simulation, it is the job of the relevant packing method to
 * convert them to a cell-centered basis before packing them into the
 * buffer.
 *
 * The concrete strategy object is responsible for supplying an
 * implementation of packMaterialFractionsIntoDoubleBuffer().  If
 * species are used, packSpeciesFractionsIntoDoubleBuffer() must also
 * be implemented.  If material state variables are used,
 * packMaterialStateVariableIntoDoubleBuffer() must be implemented.

    * This function, which must be implemented whenever materials are
    * used if the sparse packing format is to be used. Packing traverses the
    * patch in a column major order (i.e. (f(x_0,y_0,z_0), f(x_1,y_0,z_0),
    * f(x_2,y_0,z_0), ...) ). If the current cell is clean, then the material
    * number of the material occupying the cell should be packed in to the
    * buffer. If the cell is mixed, then a negative index (i.e., with numbering
    * begining at -1) into the auxilliary mix_zones, mix_mat, vol_fracs, and
    * next_mat vectors which will contain the sparse representation of the
    * volume fractions (VisIt will correct the negative index internally and
    * offset to a zero based representation).  For each component of a mixed
    * cell packMaterialFractionsIntoDoubleBuffer() should pack an entry in the
    * following vectors: mix_zones: the cell number with which the fraction is
    * associated mix_mat: the material number of the fraction vol_fracs: the
    * volume fraction of the current material next_mat: either the (positive
    * but still offset by one) index to the next mixed component within the
    * auxilliary vectors or a 0, indicating the end of the mixed components for
    * this cell.
    *
    * If a non-zero ghost cell vector was specified when
    * registerMaterialNames() was invoked, then ghost data
    * corresponding to this ghost cell vector must be packed into this

    * A enumerated PACK_RETURN_TYPE is used for a return value.  To

    * value to ALL_ONE to indicate that a single material occupies 100% of
    * each cell on the patch. Otherwise, MIXTURE should be returned even if
    * individual cells are not mixed, as this indicates that the patch contains
