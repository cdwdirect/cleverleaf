  @page package_mathematical_operations Mathematical Operations Package
 
  The Mathematical Operations Package contains classes that provide basic
  numerical operations for array-based (i.e., cell-centered, face-centered, 
  side-centered, node-centered, and edge-centered quantities) data on an 
  AMR patch hierarchy.  Routines include arithmetic as well as other 
  operations, such as dot products and norms.   Operations may be applied 
  on individual patches or collections of patch levels in an AMR hierarchy.
  For each patch data type, two sets of classes are provided.  One provides 
  operations for a single patch.  The other performs operations on hierarchy 
  levels.  The hierarchy operation classes are implemented using the patch 
  operation classes.  The patch operation classes are implemented using 
  the array data operation classes.  The array operation classes apply to all 
  array-based patch data types.
 
  The operations are used mostly in the vector kernel classes provided 
  in the "Solvers" package.  However, they are just as easily used 
  independent of the vectors.  Many of the operations allow one to define 
  control volume elements that weight the contribution of each data entry 
  in the particular operation and geometry of the variable involved.  This 
  is particularly useful for computing quantities such as norms on a 
  locally-refined AMR hierarchy where it may be necessary to mask out regions 
  on coarser levels that are covered by refined cells.
 
  For ease of use, a simple operation manager is provided so that one may 
  obtain a pointer to an appropriate operator object by querying the manager 
  object with the variable of interest.  At this time, the manager deals
  with hierarchy operation objects only.  It is assumed that routines 
  that treat individual patches will be aware of the form of the data and
  so these routines can generate the proper operation objects directly.
  Additional operation manager capabilities may be provided in the future.
 
  Support for mathematical operations is divided into seven categories:
  -# @ref package_mathops_array "operations for array data (all others depend on these)"
  -# @ref package_mathops_cell "cell-centered data operations"
  -# edge-centered data operations
  -# face-centered data operations
  -# node-centered data operations
  -# side-centered data operations
  -# @ref package_mathops_hierarchy "hierarchy operations independent of centering (used in vectors)"
 
  All class names in the Mathematical Operations package are in the
  namespace SAMRAI::math.
 
  In the interest of brevity, we include documentation for the array 
  operation classes and those that treat cell-centered patch data only.   
  The operation classes for the other array-based patch data types are
  similar.
