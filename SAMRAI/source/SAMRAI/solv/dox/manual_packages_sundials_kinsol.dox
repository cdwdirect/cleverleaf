  @page package_solvers_packages_sundials_kinsol KINSOL Vector and Nonlinear Solver Interface

  The abstract KINSOL interface contains wrapper classes that make it 
  easier to use the KINSOL nonlinear solver package with <TT>C++</TT> 
  code in general, and SAMRAI in particular.  There exist wrappers for
  vectors as well as the complete KINSOL nonlinear algebraic equation solver.
  Apart from some minor preprocessor features, these interfaces are 
  completely independent of the SAMRAI.  The code which maps the vector 
  interface included here to the SAMRAI framework can be found in the 
  SAMRAI "Solvers" package.

  These classes provide a C++ interface to the KINSOL package, 
  which is written in C.  They are sufficiently generic that they
  may be used independently of the SAMRAI framework.  The solver class
  wraps the KINSOL data structures and function calls so that these items
  may be more easily used within a C++ program.  Static member 
  functions for the nonlinear residual calculation, preconditioner setup 
  and solve, and Jacobian-vector product are provided to link user-defined 
  versions of these routines with KINSOL.  The "abstract function" class
  serves as the interface between the solver class and user-defined 
  implementations of these routines.

  Working example codes will be provided in the near future to demonstrate
  SAMRAI-KINSOL interoperability.

  KINSOL is developed in the Center for Applied Scientific Computing (CASC)
  at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL).  For more information 
  about KINSOL, see A.G. Taylor, and A.C. Hindmarsh, "User Documentation for
  KINSOL, A Nonlinear Solver for Sequential and Parallel Computers",  
  UCRL-ID-13185, July 1998.

  Note: These classes assume that vectors based on the 
        SAMRAI::solv::SundialsAbstractVector class are used.
