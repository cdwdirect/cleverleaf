  @page package_solvers The Solver Package
 
  The Solver package provides support for applying linear, nonlinear,
  and ODE solvers on a structured AMR patch hierarchy.
  The classes are divided into four categories:
  -# @ref package_solvers_packages "C++ interfaces to specific solver libraries (e.g., PETSc)"
  -# @ref package_solvers_vectors "vector kernel support for data on an AMR composite grid"
  -# @ref package_solvers_FAC "Implementation of a FAC solver"
  -# @ref package_solvers_poisson "Poisson solvers"
  -# @ref package_solvers_nonlinear "Nonlinear solver interface"

  All class names in the Mesh package are in the namespace SAMRAI::solv.
