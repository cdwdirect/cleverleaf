  @page package_solvers_packages_sundials_cvode CVODE ODE solver interface

  The abstract CVODE interface contains wrapper classes that make it 
  easier to use the CVODE ODE solver package with C++ 
  code in general, and SAMRAI in particular.  There exist wrappers for
  Sundials vectors as well as the complete CVODE ODE solver.
  Apart from some minor preprocessor features, these interfaces are 
  completely independent of the SAMRAI.  The code which maps the vector 
  interface included here to the SAMRAI framework can be found in the 
  SAMRAI "Solvers" package.

  These classes provide a C++ interface to the CVODE package, 
  which is written in C.  They are sufficiently generic that they
  may be used independently of the SAMRAI framework.  The solver class
  wraps the CVODE data structures and function calls so that these items
  may be more easily used within a C++ program.  Static member 
  functions for the right hand side function evaluation, preconditioner setup 
  and preconditioner solve are provided to link user-defined 
  versions of these routines with CVODE and CVSpgmr.  The "abstract 
  function" class serves as the interface between the solver class 
  and user-defined implementations of these routines.

  CVODE/CVODE was developed in the Center for Applied Scientific Computing 
  (CASC) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL).  For more 
  information about CVODE and a complete description of the operations 
  and data structures used by this class, see S.D. Cohen and A.C. 
  Hindmarsh, "CVODE User Guide", UCRL-MA-118618, Lawrence Livermore National
  Laboratory, 1994.

  Note: These classes assume that vectors based on the 
        SundialsAbstractVector class are used.
