 * @brief Class VariableFillPattern is an abstract base class that provides an
 * interface to create objects that can calculate overlaps which correspond
 * to a specific stencil.
 *
 * If an object of a concrete VariableFillPattern type is provided when
 * registering a refine operation with a RefineAlgorithm, then BoxOverlap
 * calculations associated with that refine operation will use the
 * VariableFillPattern implementation to restrict the overlaps to only a
 * desired subset of the the intersection between the source and destination
 * patches.  Thus only data within that subset will be filled when
 * RefineSchedule::fillData() is called.  For example, an implementation of
 * this class may be used to restrict the filling of data to locations on or
 * near a patch boundary.
