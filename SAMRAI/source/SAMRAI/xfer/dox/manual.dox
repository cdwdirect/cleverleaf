  The Transfer package provides generic data communication capabilities 
  for moving data on a structured AMR patch hierarchy.  This support is
  divided into these categories: 
  -# @ref package_transfer_operators "spatial coarsen/refine and time interpolation operator interfaces"
  -# @ref package_transfer_datamovers "classes for moving data between patch levels on an AMR patch hierarchy"

  All class names in the Transfer package are in the SAMRAI::xfer namespace.
