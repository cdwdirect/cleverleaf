  @page package_algorithm_method_of_lines Time Integration with Method of Lines

  This algorithm supports time-integration of a system of ODEs defined on
  a hierarchy using a Strong Stability Preserving Runge-Kutta scheme.  
  Unlike the time-refinement algorithm, this method does not
  perform different time-stepping at each level. Rather, it integrates
  all patches in the AMR hierarchy through the same time increment.

  The routine that integrates the quantities on all patches by a specified
  timestep is @b advanceHierarchy.  It implements Runge-Kutta
  integration with information passed between hierarchy levels at each
  Runge-Kutta step.  The user can choose the order of time-accuracy of 
  the Runge-Kutta integrator and can supply the necessary array of increments
  for each sub-step.  The timestep is determined through a 
  Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition.  The patch with the minimum 
  timestep based on this condition defines the timestep used for integration 
  of the entire hierarchy. 

  The method is implemented using the Strategy object-oriented design pattern 
  in which the integrator provides the algorithm and the strategy provides a 
  set of virtual functions that plug into the integrator class.  The user can 
  interact with the class by explicitly defining the virtual functions 
  contained in the strategy.  See the Convection Diffusion example for 
  a demonstration on use of these classes.
