  @page package_algorithm The Algorithm Package
 
  The Algorithm package contains classes that are useful for composing 
  structured AMR solution algorithms at a high-level.  Algorithm support
  is divided into these categories:
  -# @ref package_algorithm_time_refinement "time integration over AMR patch hierarchy using local time refinement"
  -# @ref package_algorithm_method_of_lines "time integration over AMR patch hierarchy using method of lines"
  -# @ref package_algorithm_hyperbolic "explicit hydrodynamics over levels in AMR patch hierarchy (i.e., hyperbolic conservation laws)"
  -# @ref package_algorithm_implicit "implicit time-integration over AMR patch hierarchy"
  -# @ref package_algorithm_femutils "utilities useful for finite element computations on an AMR patch hierarchy"
 
  All class names in the Algorithm package are in the namespace SAMRAI::algs.
