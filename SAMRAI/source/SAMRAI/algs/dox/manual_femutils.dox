  @page package_algorithm_femutils Rudimentary Support for Finite Element Operations on SAMR Meshes

  The Algorithm package contains some basic functionality for summing node and edge data quantities
  at shared points between neighboring patches.  Such operations are commonly found in finite element
  computations.  For example, when applying finite element integration that take contributions from
  each element to a node or edge, one can divide the problem into patches, do operations on each
  patch, and then accumulate the neighboring patch contributions by employing a patch boundary node
  or edge sum. These classes are partitioned into two categories:

  These classes provide basic operations for summing data across patches at
  shared grid points.
