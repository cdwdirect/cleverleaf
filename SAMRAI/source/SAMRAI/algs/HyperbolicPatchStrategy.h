/**
 * Class HyperbolicPatchStrategy is an abstract base class defining the
 * interface between an HyperbolicLevelIntegrator object and operations
 * applied to a single patch in a structured AMR hierarchy.   The operations
 * include patch initialization, dt calculation, flux computation,
 * conservative differencing, and error estimation.  This class is derived
 * from the xfer::RefinePatchStrategy and xfer::CoarsenPatchStrategy
 * abstract base classes.   These base classes provide the interface for
 * user-defined interlevel data refining and coarsening operations and the
 * specification of physical boundary conditions.  The functions
 * setPhysicalBoundaryConditions(), and pre/postprocessRefine() are
 * overloaded from the class xfer::RefinePatchStrategy.  The operations
 * pre/postprocessCoarsen() are overloaded from xfer::CoarsenPatchStrategy.
 * The pre/postprocessCoarsen/Refine() operations are given empty
 * implementations here so that the user does not need to proovide them if
 * the operations are not needed.
 *
 * It is important to recognize that for the concrete patch strategy subclass
 * and the HyperbolicLevelIntegrator to work together, the concrete
 * strategy must know which patch data to operate on.  The patch data storage
 * is manipulated by the level integrator.  The set/clearDataContext() methods
 * allow the integrator to inform the patch strategy of the correct data
 * context.  The concrete patch strategy subclass can access the appropriate
 * context via the getDataContext() method.
