#########################################################################

This test exercises tree-based box searches multiblock configurations.
The files included in this directory are as follows:
 
   main-mblktree.C       -  Entire code for the test
   test_inputs/*.input   -  Input files for a variety of 2D and 3D
                            multiblock configurations

 
COMPILATION AND EXECUTION
-------------------------
   Compilation:
      make main

   Execution:
      serial:
         ./main <input_file> 
      parallel:
         Parallel execution is platform dependent.  This example demonstrates
         execution via mpirun.
         mpirun -np <nprocs> [mpirun options] ./main <input_file>


INPUT PARAMETERS
----------------
Refer to test_inputs/mbtree.3blk.simple.2d.input for a full description of all
input parameters specific to this problem.

The provided input files test a variety of 2D and 3D multiblock configurations.
The files with "simple" in their names test the box searches on levels that
have a relatively small number of boxes.  The files with "subdivided" in their
names use levels with the number of boxes increased by subdividing all boxes
to enforce a given maximum box size.

RESETTING BASELINES
-------------------
The tests that are run from this directory include comparisons of the results
to baseline data that represent expected results.  The tests compare a
Connector that is built using the multiblock tree search functionality to
baseline data that contains the expected contents of that Connector.
The baseline data are stored in HDF data files in the test_inputs directory,
one HDF file for each input file.

If a SAMRAI developer makes changes to the library that can legitimately change
the box configuration of a level, then the baselines here need to be reset,
according to the following steps:

1. Set the flag "generate_baseline" in each input file to TRUE.

2. make check.  The baseline HDF files will be regenerated here.

3. Remove the flag "generate_baseline" from the input files, or set it to
   FALSE.

4. make checktest (there should be no more errors).
