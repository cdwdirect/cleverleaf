This README explains how to use the AMR Euler sample application
code in the SAMRAI library.  The files included in this directory
are as follows:  

          main.C      -  application driver program
          Euler.[C,h] -  C++ class containing routines specific to the 
                         Euler example and which are called 
                         from SAMRAI AMR library routines
          EulerFort.h -  header file defining external fortran routines
          fortran     - Fortran numerical routines for 2d and 3d problems

To understand the construction of this application code from pieces 
specific to the Euler model and more generic pieces in the SAMRAI
library consider the object construction pattern in the main.C file.
For more details on these files and the Euler class consult the comments
in those files and the Euler.h class header file.

COMPILATION AND EXECUTION
-------------------------
   Compilation:
      make main

   Execution:
      For the input files in the performance_inputs/mEuler directory
      serial:
         ./main <input file>
      parallel:
         Parallel execution is platform dependent.  This example demonstrates
         execution via mpirun.
         mpirun -np <nprocs> [mpirun options] ./main <input file>


INPUT FILES:
