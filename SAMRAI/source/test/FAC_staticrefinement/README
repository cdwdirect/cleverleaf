## Description:   Unit test of the FAC solver
##
#########################################################################

This is a unit test of the  FAC solver. The tests use pre-set, user defined
refined boxes so the adaptivity is not connected to the evolution of the
solution.  Hence the "nonadaptive" in the test name.  The files included in
this directory are as follows:
 
   FACPoisson.[Ch]  -      Class to set up and solve the scalar Poisson
                           equation.
   main.C               -  example main program
   test_inputs/*.input  -  2d and 3d input files
   example_inputs       -  2d and 3d example problems

Class FACPoisson uses the solver defined in CellPoissonFACSolver.
This class assembles the the FAC algorithm in FACPreconditioner,
and the level operations in CellPoissonFACOps.  It uses the
Robin boundary condition, which is accessed through the virtual
interface defined by RobinBcCoefStrategy class.

This example uses the library-implemented LocationIndexRobinBcCoefs
version of the Robin boundary condition.  Other versions of Robin
boundary conditions may be used, including user-defined.  See the
RobinBcCoefStrategy class.  The boundary conditions specified
in the input files are parsed by that the LocationIndexRobinBcCoefs
class.
 

COMPILATION AND EXECUTION
-------------------------
   Compilation:
      make main

   Execution:
      serial:
         ./main default.[2,3]d.input
      parallel:
         Parallel execution is platform dependent.  This example demonstrates
         execution via mpirun.
         mpirun -np <nprocs> [mpirun options] ./main test_inputs/default.[2,3]d.input
 

INPUT PARAMETERS
----------------

parameters specific to this problem.
