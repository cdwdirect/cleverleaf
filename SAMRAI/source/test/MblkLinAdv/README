#########################################################################

This README explains how to compile and run the Multiblock Linear Advection
application.  The files in this directory are as follows:

    main.C             -  application driver program
    MblkLinAdv.[C,h]   -  C++ class containing routines specific to the
                          Linear Advection example and which are called from
                          SAMRAI AMR library routines
    MblkGeometry.[C,h] -  Class managing the physical coordinate geometry
                          of the problem.
    SkeletonOutersideDoubleWeightedAverage.[C,h]
                       -  A coarsening operator needed for this problem  

This example is similar to the single-block AMR LinAdv sample application.
This example has the following differences:

   1. It works on non-cartesian mapped grids 
   2. It works with multiblock grids
   3. All numerical kernel operations (e.g. computeFluxesOnPatch()) are
      c-based rather than fortran

The two test cases included are:

   1. wedge_1blk.3d  - single block mapped wedge grid 
   2. octant_3blk.3d - multi block (3 blocks) mapped octant grid 

Note that the numerics for this example have not been fully tested in 2D so it
currently should only run in 3D.
 
COMPILATION AND EXECUTION
-------------------------
   Compilation:
      make main

   Execution:
      For one of the following input files:
         test_inputs/octant_3blk.3d.input
         test_inputs/wedge_1blk.3d.input
      serial:
         ./main <input file>
      parallel:
         Parallel execution is platform dependent.  This example demonstrates
         execution via mpirun.
         mpirun -np <nprocs> [mpirun options] ./main <input file>

INPUT PARAMETERS
----------------
Refer to test_inputs/octant_3blk.3d.input for full description of all input
parameters specific to this problem.
