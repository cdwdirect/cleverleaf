/**
 * Class MblkHyperbolicLevelIntegrator provides routines needed to
 * integrate a system of hyperbolic conservation laws on a structured
 * AMR patch hierarchy using local time refinement.  The routines include
 * initializing a level, advance a level, and synchronize levels in a
 * time-dependent AMR application.  The AMR timestepping algorithm that
 * cycles through the patch levels and calls these routines is provided by
 * the TimeRefinementIntegrator class.  Together, that hierarchy
 * integration class and this single level integration class produce the
 * common AMR algorithm due to Berger, Colella and Oliger
 * (see e.g., Berger and Colella, J. Comp. Phys. (82)1:64-84, 1989).
 * The operations performed on single patches on each level are implemented
 * in the user-defined, problem-specific class derived from the abstract
 * base class HyperbolicPatchStrategy.
 *
 * It is important to note that the variable contexts used by the concrete
 * patch strategy subclass must be consistent with those defined in this
 * class which manages the data for the variables.
 *
 * This class is derived from the abstract base class
 * TimeRefinementLevelStrategy, which defines routines needed by
 * the time refinement integrator.  There is an argument in the constructor
 * that determines whether this class will be used by the time
 * refinement integrator for refined timestepping or synchronized
 * timestepping.  The routines overloaded in
 * TimeRefinementLevelStrategy are: initializeLevelIntegrator(),
 * getLevelDt(), getMaxFinerLevelDt(), advanceLevel(),
 * standardLevelSynchronization(), synchronizeNewLevels(),
 * resetTimeDependentData(), and resetDataToPreadvanceState().
 * This class is also derived from mesh::StandardTagAndInitStrategy,
 * which defines routines needed by the gridding algorithm classes.  The
 * routines overloaded in mesh::StandardTagAndInitStrategy are:
 * initializeLevelData(), resetHierarchyConfiguration(),
 * applyGradientDetector(), applyRichardsonExtrapolation(), and
 * coarsenDataForRichardsonExtrapolation().
 *
 * An object of this class requires numerous parameters to be read from
 * input.  Also, data must be written to and read from files for restart.
 * The input and restart data are summarized as follows.
 *
 * Required input keys and data types: NONE
 *
 * Optional input keys, data types, and defaults:
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *    - \b    cfl
 *       double value for the CFL factor used for timestep selection
 *       (dt used = CFL * max dt).  If no input value is given, a default
 *       value of 0.9 is used.
 *
 *    - \b    cfl_init
 *       double value for CFL factor used for initial timestep.
 *       If no input value is given, a default value of 0.9 is used.
 *
 *    - \b    lag_dt_computation
 *       boolean value indicating whether dt is based on current
 *       solution or solution from previous step (possible optimization
 *       in communication for characteristic analysis).  If no input
 *       value is given, a default value of TRUE is used.
 *
 *
 *    - \b    use_ghosts_to_compute_dt
 *       boolean value indicating whether ghost data must be filled before
 *       timestep is computed on each patch (possible communication
 *       optimization).  if no input value is given, a default value
 *       of TRUE is used.
 *
 *    - \b    distinguish_mpi_reduction_costs
 *       boolean specifying whether to separate reduction costs in tbox::MPI
 *       from costs of load imbalances.  By specifying it true, a
 *       barrier is put in place before the reduction call, so an extra
 *       operation is incurred.  For this reason, it is defaulted FALSE.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Note that when continuing from restart, the input values in the
 * input file override all values read in from the restart database.
 *
 * A sample input file entry might look like:
 *
 * \verbatim
 *
 *    cfl = 0.9
 *    cfl_init = 0.9
 *    lag_dt_computation = FALSE
 *    use_ghosts_to_compute_dt = TRUE
 *    distinguish_mpi_reduction_costs = TRUE

    * The boolean arguments are used to determine the state of the algorithm
    * and the data when the advance routine is called.   The first_step
    * and last_step indicate whether the step is the first or last in the

    * flux information is not maintained and flux integrals are not updated.

    * as Richardson extrapolation, a temporary level that is not in the
    * hierarchy is created and advanced.  Then, a communication schedule
    * must be generated for the level before the advance begins.
    *

    * during the regular time advance sequence, and possibly at the initial
    * simulation time.  The second call advances the solution on a coarser
    * level ahead in time to provide time-dependent boundary values for some
    * finer level when time-dependent regridding is used.  In the first case,
    * the values of the boolean flags are:
    *
    *
    *
    *    - \b  first_step
    *        = true for first step in level time step sequence; else, false.

    *    - \b  regrid_advance
    *        = true.
    *
    *
    *
    *
    * When time-dependent regridding (i.e., Richardson extrapolation) is
    * used, the routine is called from two different points in addition to
    * those described above: to advance a temporary level that is coarser
    * than the hierarchy level on which error estimation is performed, and
    * to advance the hierarchy level itself.  In the first case, the values of
    * the boolean flags are:

    * In the second case, the values of the boolean flags are:

    *      (when regridding during time integration sequence)
    *        = true when the level is not coarsest level to synchronize
    *          immediately before the regridding process; else, false.
    *      (when generating initial hierarchy construction)
    *        = true, even though there may be multiple advance steps.
    *    - \b  last_step
    *        = true when the advance is the last in the Richardson
    *          extrapolation step sequence; else false.
