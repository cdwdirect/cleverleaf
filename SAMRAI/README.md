# SAMRAI

SAMRAI (Structured Adaptive Mesh Refinement Application Infrastructure) is an
object-oriented C++ software library that enables exploration of numerical,
algorithmic, parallel computing, and software issues associated with applying
structured adaptive mesh refinement (SAMR) technology in large-scale parallel
application development. SAMRAI provides software tools for developing SAMR
applications that involve coupled physics models, sophisticated numerical
solution methods, and which require high-performance parallel computing
hardware. SAMRAI enables integration of SAMR technology into existing codes and
simplifies the exploration of SAMR methods in new application domains. 

## New Release

SAMRAI v. 2.13.0 is now available! The major change is that we no longer use
the Boost library. This affects many interfaces in the API that used
boost::shared_ptr, which has been replaced by std::shared_ptr.

## Get Involved

SAMRAI is an open source project, and questions, discussion and contributions
are welcome!

### Mailing List

To get in touch with all the SAMRAI developers, please email samrai@llnl.gov

### Contributions

Contributing to SAMRAI should be easy! We are managing contributions through
pull requents here on GitHub. When you create your pull request, please make
`master` the target branch.

Your PR must pass all of SAMRAI's unit tests, which are enforced using Travis
CI. For information on how to run these tests locally, please see our
[contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md)

The `master` branch contains the latest development, and releases are tagged.
New features should be created in `feature/<name>`branches and be based on
`master`.
