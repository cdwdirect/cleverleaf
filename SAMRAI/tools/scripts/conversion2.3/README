Utilities to aid in converting code to work with SAMRAI 2.3 name
changes.

To use simply run the "convert2.3" script in the root directory of the
source code to convert. The script will search for all .C, .I and .h
files and perform several method renames.

The methods to rename are listed in the *.data files in this
directory; if you use these method names in non-SAMRAI related code
this script is not recommended since it is performing a simple text
replacement.  [If anyone can recommend a good refactoring tool for C++
please email samrai@llnl.gov.  We would really prefer to have a
language aware replace capability].

IMPORTANT: As with all automatic source modifications, make sure you
have a backup of the code before using the script.
